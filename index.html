    <h1>🥐Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      One bite of a croissant just pulled from the oven at Michel Lyczak’s
      bakery in the southern Parisian suburb of Malakoff is bliss: a satisfying
      crunch and scattering of crumbs, the indulgent mouthfeel of butter wrapped
      in the overwhelming sensation of lightness. Few foods are as culturally
      iconic as this flaky breakfast food, so quintessentially French that many
      English speakers defer to its native pronunciation (krwa-sohn).
